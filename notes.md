STANDUP

Wins:
New / Create Route / Storing Profile and Post in Database with a user

Blocks:
Injecting Multiple Model Information into views. So like on the user home screen using EJS tags to pull in name of the business or info from their post since that uses the users route info and the post route info we kept getting not defined.

Today:
Complete 7 restful routes

flash messages need to be updated
styling on show page needs too
you shouldn't be able to edit/delete a post (or anything) unless its yours (res.locals thing, but not sure) -- this is on the allJobs page
-- fix hover and hide for sub nav
-- maybe ask TA why the fonts arent showing on my browser

*******  when you log in, it brings up the logout -- we dont want to see login in the nav when yhou're logged in ********
