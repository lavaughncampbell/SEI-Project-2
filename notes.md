STANDUP

Wins:
New / Create Route / Storing Profile and Post in Database with a user

Blocks:
Injecting Multiple Model Information into views. So like on the user home screen using EJS tags to pull in name of the business or info from their post since that uses the users route info and the post route info we kept getting not defined.

Today:
Complete 7 restful routes

- if you click on developer checkbox
- the logic will switch like you are a developer not a business
- how that will look is the user home page will see my job or my offers. The how it work on the user home page will be updated for a developer instructions. The button will switch to make offer. it will have the offer form which we will need to use the offer model for. When you make a offer it will go under my offer, and same like a business a developer can show, edit, update, and delete their offer.
// are you a developer button on profile page needs styling
styling on show page needs too
you shouldn't be able to edit/delete a post (or anything) unless its yours (res.locals thing, but not sure) -- this is on the allJobs page
-- fix hover and hide for sub nav
-- maybe ask TA why the fonts arent showing on my browser

*******  when you log in, it brings up the logout -- we dont want to see login in the nav when yhou're logged in ********

*** from allJobs page, when clicking into a (individual job) job page, the user shouldn't be able to make edits or delete a job post.  ONLY WANT DEVELOPERS TO SEE A button that says "make offer" on that page. ***
-- want this to be speicic to the dev whos viewin the show page IN ORDER TO MAKE ABN OFFER



// does the user need to be able to edit their PROFILE? // (would be edit button on the userHome page in teh profile box)
// are you a developer button on profile page needs styling

NEEDS WORKS — INCOMPLETE


// 4. // OFFED PLACED
Business can login and see new offer from Developer — Incomplete
- when the business logs back in they will see a box for new offer.


// 5. // VIEW OFFER
Business can click on new offer and bring them to developer off show page — Incomplete
- Once the business clics on the new offer it will bring up a show page for the develper who offered.


// 6. // NEW HIRE DECISION

- Once the business clicks hire or not hire that will be referreced back on the offer.


// 7. // OFFER ACCEPTED CONGRATS!
If Hire Developer can login and see new hire on their main user screen.
- Developer will click the checkbox and the logic will switch with a new hire button on the my offers box. This is the end of the functionality for MVP.



/// PRESENTATION NOTES ///
-- show to others
-- wear something nice
-- what to talk about
-- tour of the site
-- something proud of
-- something that was really tough
-- "wanted the profile input page to be a part of registration without it being the register page" (big reason is that we needed to find out if the user is a developer or not, because the site functions one way for businesses looking for coders, and another way for developers to make offers on jobs)
  -- we were able to keep the registration page super simple, with just email and password
